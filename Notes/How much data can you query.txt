I think i only need to run workers

/miner/:miner/workers

there are ~80,000 miners.

You can make 100 requests / 15 minutes per ip address.

Hours it will take (um miners) 80,000 / 400 = 200 hours.

If I get this to run on several computers, or through spoofing IP addresses. It should take significantly less time than that.
20 IP addresses. Might be able to use a vpn or Tor depending.

List of 100 Ip addresses. do 15 get requests, save that data to a file. change IP. Repeat until done. 2 hours.

Another option is just to let them run on several computers in the computer lab. 

To get the entire dataset of every miner, assuming I already have all the miner addresses.

It would take ~9 days running 24/7.

I don't know how large this would be.


Problem:How to get all teh data in less than a day. Without sacrefricing  my computer.
